# unity-spawn-follow-demo

A basic Unity project demonstration on entity tracking and UI modification. The user controls an icon that can shoot with the Space button. Colliding with planes destroyes those planes. Shooting planes or waypoints will decrement their health until destroyed. Planes will follow a path of waypoints in either sequential order (A to F) or in random order.
